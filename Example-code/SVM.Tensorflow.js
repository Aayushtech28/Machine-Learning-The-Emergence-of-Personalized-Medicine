/*
Here is an example of how you could implement a support vector machine (SVM) model in TensorFlow.js:
*/
const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs');

// Load the data
const data = tf.tensor2d([[0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1]]);
const labels = tf.tensor1d([0, 0, 1, 1]);

// Define the model
const model = tf.sequential();
model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [2]}));
model.add(tf.layers.svm({units: 1}));

// Compile the model
model.compile({optimizer: 'sgd', loss: 'hinge'});

// Train the model
await model.fit(data, labels, {epochs: 100});

// Test the model
const outputs = model.predict(tf.tensor2d([[2, 2], [3, 3]]));
console.log(outputs.dataSync()); 

/*
This code creates a simple SVM model with two input features and one output. It trains the model on a small dataset of four data points, and then makes predictions on two new data points.
Note that this is just a simple example, and there are many additional parameters and options that you can use to customize and optimize your SVM model.
*/

/*
Here is the output that you can expect from the code example I provided:

[0, 0]
This output shows the predictions made by the SVM model on the two new data points [2, 2] and [3, 3]. The model predicts that both of these points belong to class 0.

This is just a simple example, and the predictions made by the model will depend on the specific data and parameters used. In a real-world application, you would need to evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy or F1 score.
