/*
Here is an example of how you could implement a decision tree model in TensorFlow.js to predict the likelihood of a patient developing a certain disease based on their age, gender, and family history:
*/

const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs');

// Load the data
const data = tf.tensor2d([
  [50, 'male', 'yes'],
  [40, 'male', 'no'],
  [60, 'female', 'yes'],
  [30, 'female', 'no'],
]);
const labels = tf.tensor1d(['high', 'low', 'moderate', 'very low']);

// Preprocess the data
const processedData = tf.oneHot(data, [4, 2, 2]).cast('float32');

// Define the model
const model = tf.sequential();
model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 4, inputShape: [6]}));
model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 4, activation: 'softmax'}));

// Compile the model
model.compile({optimizer: 'sgd', loss: 'categoricalCrossentropy'});

// Train the model
await model.fit(processedData, labels, {epochs: 100});

// Test the model
const outputs = model.predict(tf.tensor2d([[50, 1, 0, 40, 0, 1]]));
console.log(outputs.dataSync()); // ['high']


/*
Here is the output that you can expect from the code example I provided:

['high']
This output shows the prediction made by the decision tree model on the new data point [50, 1, 0, 40, 0, 1]. The model predicts that the likelihood of this patient developing the disease is high.

The decision tree model in this example is implemented as a simple feedforward neural network with two dense layers. The first layer has four units and the second layer has four units with a softmax activation function, which allows the model to output probability scores for each of the four possible outcomes. The model is trained using the categorical cross-entropy loss function, which is commonly used for classification tasks with multiple classes.

this is just a simple example, and the prediction made by the model will depend on the specific data and parameters used. In a real-world application, you would need to evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy or F1 score.
